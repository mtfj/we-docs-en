"Waves Enterprise Blockchain Platform is a universal solution for a "
"scalable digital infrastructure that combines properties of public and "
"private blockchains for enterprise and state usage. The enterprise "
"blockchain platform solves the problem of trust between the parties not "
"at the level of business logic, but at the level of the platform "
"operation protocol. Supported PoS and PoA consensuses guarantee "
"correctness of data added to the blockchain, while decentralization "
"provides counterparty independence in terms of data access."
