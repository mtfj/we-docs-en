"Vostok Blockchain Platform is a universal solution for a scalable digital"
" infrastructure that combines properties of public and private "
"blockchains for enterprise and state usage. The enterprise blockchain "
"platform solves the problem of trust between the parties not at the level"
" of business logic, but at the level of the platform operation protocol. "
