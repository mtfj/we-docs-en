# Vostok docs

Vostok Blockchain Platform is a universal solution for a scalable digital infrastructure that combines properties of public and private blockchains for enterprise and state usage. The enterprise blockchain platform solves the problem of trust between the parties not at the level of business logic, but at the level of the platform operation protocol. Supported PoS and PoA consensuses guarantee correctness of data added to the blockchain, while decentralization provides counterparty independence in terms of data access.
